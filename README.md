# Deep-Learning-for-Noise-Denoising-and-Classification
This project uses CNNs to classify MNIST Fashion dataset images and denoise noisy ones. A CNN classifier is trained on clean images and tested on clean and noisy ones. An autoencoder denoises the noisy images, and an end-to-end denoising-classifier network is trained for simultaneous noise removal and classification.
